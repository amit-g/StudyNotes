* SQL Server
  * TDB: Dynamic data masking
    * Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer
    * Default, Number, and Custom String are valid options
  * TBD: Transparent data encryption (TDE)
    * Master Key -> Certificate -> Database Encryption Key -> Database Encryption
  * TBD: Row level security
  * TBD: Blocking predicate
* Azure Data Factory
  * The default value for writeBatchSize is 10,000 (number of records per batch)
  * Gantt view allows you to see all the pipeline runs grouped by name, annotation, or tag created in the pipeline, and it also displays bars relative to how long the run took
  * TBD: ADF to Log Analytics
    * Azure-Diagnostics mode
      * AzureDiagnostics
    * Resource-Specific mode
      * ADFActivityRun, ADFPipelineRun, ADFSSISIntegrationRuntimeLogs, and ADFSSISPackageExecutableStatistics
* Stream Analytics Query Language
  * TBD: Streaming unit and streaming node
  * Windowing Functions
    * Tumbling Window
      * Fixed-sized, non-overlapping and contiguous time intervals
      * ``` {TUMBLINGWINDOW | TUMBLING} ( timeunit  , windowsize, [offsetsize] ) ```
      * ``` {TUMBLINGWINDOW | TUMBLING} ( Duration( timeunit  , windowsize ), [Offset(timeunit  , offsetsize)] ) ```
      * Exclusive in the beginning and inclusive in the end of the window
    * Hopping Window
      * Scheduled overlapping windows
      * ``` {HOPPINGWINDOW | HOPPING} ( timeunit  , windowsize , hopsize, [offsetsize] ) ```
      * ``` {HOPPINGWINDOW | HOPPING} ( Duration( timeunit  , windowsize ) , Hop (timeunit  , windowsize ), [Offset(timeunit  , offsetsize)]) ```
      * Tumbling windows are simply a hopping window whose hop is equal to its size
    * Sliding Window
      * ``` {SLIDINGWINDOW | SLIDING} ( timeunit, windowsize ) ```
      * ``` {SLIDINGWINDOW | SLIDING} ( Duration( timeunit, windowsize ) ) ```
    * Session Window
      * A session window begins when the first event occurs. If another event occurs within the specified timeout from the last ingested event, then the window extends to include the new event. Otherwise if no events occur within the timeout, then the window is closed at the timeout
      * If events keep occurring within the specified timeout, the session window will keep extending until maximum duration is reached
      * The actual duration of a session window could then be up to twice maxDuration
      * ![Session windows end condition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream-analytics-query/media/session-window-azure-stream-analytics/streamanalytics-sessionwindow_endconditions.png)
      * ``` {SESSIONWINDOW | SESSION} (timeunit, timeoutSize, maxDurationSize) [OVER (PARTITION BY partitionKey)] ```
      * ``` {SESSIONWINDOW | SESSION} (Timeout(timeunit , timeoutSize), MaxDuration(timeunit, maxDurationSize)) [OVER (PARTITION BY partitionKey)] ```
    * Snapshot Window
      * Snapshot windows groups events that have the same timestamp
      * ``` System.Timestamp() ```
  * Performance of SQL queries running on the dedicated SQL pool
    * Monitor page of Azure Synapse Studio, review the SQL requests tab
    * Query the sys.dm_pdw_exec_request view
* Azure Synapse Analytics
  * Apache Spark pool
    * cache() transformation preserves data in the memory
    * persist() transformation preserves data in the memory or disk (MEMORY_ONLY or MEMORY_AND_DISK)
  * Dynamics management view
    * sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions shows the status of the sessions
    * sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests shows the requests that are in process, completed, failed, or closed
      * Labels for queries are available from sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests
    * sys.dm_exec_requests and sys.dm_exec_sessions are used by Microsoft SQL Server
  * Commands
    * DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN - The execution plan for the specific distribution is available by busing the 
    * Set-AzSqlDatabase - Scaling the database up
* Microsoft Purview
  * Azure Synapse Analytics data assets
    * Microsoft Purview requires role membership
      * Read access to the Azure Synapse workspace (Reader role for the Azure Synapse Workspace resource in the Azure subscription)
      * Read access to each SQL database that will be scanned (db_datareader fixed database role in each database)
      * Read access to data lake storage (Storage Blob Data Reader role for the Azure Storage account)
    * To connect a Purview account by using the Synapse Studio interface, you require Collection Administrator access to the Purview account's root collection. After successfully connecting the account, the managed identity used by your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace will be added to the collection's Data Curator role.
