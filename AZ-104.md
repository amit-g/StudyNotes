  * Standard LB can only use Standard Public IP which doesn't allow inbound traffic by default
  * Public IP address can't be picked
* Storage
  * Premium storage account can only be LRS
  * GRS and GZRS are not supported for Azure Files
  * Rehydrating archive to cool doesn't change modification days count
  * Blob accessed from cool tier is moved to hot tier

  * Internet Explorer Enhanced Security must be disabled for both Admins/Users
  * System volume can be synced but cannot use cloud tiering
  * Data tiering policy for multiple endpoints on same volume would result in using the most restrictive policy
  * Free space policy has higher precedence (over others e.g. modified date)
  * Media and zipfiles, when needed can be downloaded partially. All other types are fully downloaded
  * Mount point vs server endpoint???
  * Server on which the Azure File Sync agent is installed can sync with up to 30 Azure file shares
  * File share is represented as Cloud endpoint which can be only one within a sync group
  * As many server endpoints within a sync group
  * Sync group acts like a replication hub
  * A server can sync with multiple sync groups (each with different server endpoint)
  * Changes made to Azure File share directly can take up to 24 hrs to sync (the job runs once a day)
  * Pre-seeding requires manually copying files and downtime
  * Cloud endpoint -> Storage + Share
  * Server endpoint -> Registered Server + Volume or Path
  * Sync Group-> Clout endpoint + Server endpoint

  * VNET peerings are not transitive
  * VNET peerings are directional i.e. both directions have to be configured separately
  * NAT and Load balancing
  * NGS rules apply to the traffic between the VMs in same subnet
  * Service tags * Internet, Virtual Network
  * VMs in peered VNETs don't resolve each other so some external DNS solution is needed e.g. Azure Private DNS
  * Azure provided DNS can allow VMs to resolve each other as long as all VMs are within same VNET
* Network performance monitor
  * Client based windows computer can't make raw TCP requests (use ICMP to troubleshoot)
  * TCP port 8084 is needed but only if raw TCP tests are used (i.e. not needed for ICMP)
  * ICMP is less reliable as routers deprioritize it
  * Log Analytic agent for this can be installed on one computer per subnet i.e. all computers don't need it
  * Default monitoring rules on a large network can cause performance issue
  * Could based network monitoring solutions

  * Network performance monitor - blackholing, routing errors
  * Next Hop - troubleshoot the routing issues
* Site2Site VPN
  * Network gateway has two VMs * Active-Passive
  * Local network gateway is one to one with on-prem devices
